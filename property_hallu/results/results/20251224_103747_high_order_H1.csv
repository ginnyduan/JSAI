A_no_tool,"Let's find a stable material with a band gap between 1 and 3 eV and report its formation energy per atom.

**Material Selection:**

A common and well-studied semiconductor that fits this band gap requirement is **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)**.

*   **Band Gap:** The experimental band gap of GaAs at room temperature is approximately **1.42 eV**. This falls comfortably within the desired range of 1 to 3 eV.
*   **Stability:** GaAs is a widely used and commercially available semiconductor, indicating its inherent stability under normal conditions. It's a direct band gap semiconductor, making it suitable for optoelectronic applications.

**Formation Energy per Atom:**

The formation energy of a compound is the energy released or absorbed when it is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. For a compound with the chemical formula $A_x B_y$, the formation energy per atom is typically calculated as:

$$ \Delta H_f = \frac{1}{x+y} \left( E_{compound} - x E_{element A} - y E_{element B} \right) $$

Where:
*   $E_{compound}$ is the total energy of the compound.
*   $E_{element A}$ is the energy of element A in its standard state.
*   $E_{element B}$ is the energy of element B in its standard state.

For Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), the formula is $Ga_1 As_1$. So, $x=1$ and $y=1$. The formation energy per atom is:

$$ \Delta H_f (\text{GaAs}) = \frac{1}{1+1} \left( E_{GaAs} - E_{Ga} - E_{As} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( E_{GaAs} - E_{Ga} - E_{As} \right) $$

**Finding the Formation Energy:**

The formation energy of GaAs is a well-established thermodynamic property. It can be found in various thermodynamic databases and literature.

According to standard thermodynamic data (e.g., from NIST, JANAF tables, or computational materials databases), the standard enthalpy of formation ($\Delta H_f^\circ$) for GaAs at 298.15 K is approximately:

$$ \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{GaAs}) \approx -72.8 \text{ kJ/mol} $$

To convert this to eV/atom, we need to perform the following conversions:

1.  **Convert kJ/mol to J/mol:**
    $-72.8 \text{ kJ/mol} \times 1000 \text{ J/kJ} = -72800 \text{ J/mol}$

2.  **Convert J/mol to J/atom:**
    We need to consider the number of atoms in one mole of GaAs. One mole of GaAs contains one mole of Ga atoms and one mole of As atoms, totaling two moles of atoms.
    Number of atoms per mole of GaAs = 2 moles of atoms/mol of GaAs
    Avogadro's number ($N_A$) = $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms/mol
    Number of atoms in one mole of GaAs = $2 \times N_A$ atoms

    Energy per atom = $\frac{-72800 \text{ J/mol}}{2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ atoms/mol}}$

3.  **Convert J to eV:**
    1 eV = $1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ J
    Energy per atom (in eV) = $\frac{\text{Energy per atom (in J)}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}}$

Let's calculate:

Energy per atom (in J) = $\frac{-72800}{2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx -6.056 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J/atom}$

Formation energy per atom (in eV) = $\frac{-6.056 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J/atom}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}} \approx -0.378 \text{ eV/atom}$

**Important Note on Formation Energy:**

The formation energy is often reported as a negative value, indicating that the formation of the compound from its elements is exothermic (energy is released). This signifies stability. However, when discussing ""formation energy per atom"" in the context of material stability, it's often the magnitude of this energy that is considered, or it's understood that a negative value implies stability.

In some contexts, especially in computational materials science, ""formation energy"" might refer to the energy difference calculated from first-principles calculations, which can be positive or negative depending on the reference states and computational methods. However, for established thermodynamic properties, the standard enthalpy of formation is the most reliable measure.

**Formation Energy per Atom:**

The formation energy of a compound is the energy released or absorbed when it is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. For a compound with the chemical formula $A_x B_y$, the formation energy per atom is typically calculated as:

$$ \Delta H_f = \frac{1}{x+y} \left( E_{compound} - x E_{element A} - y E_{element B} \right) $$

Where:
*   $E_{compound}$ is the total energy of the compound.
*   $E_{element A}$ is the energy of element A in its standard state.
*   $E_{element B}$ is the energy of element B in its standard state.

For Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), the formula is $Ga_1 As_1$. So, $x=1$ and $y=1$. The formation energy per atom is:

$$ \Delta H_f (\text{GaAs}) = \frac{1}{1+1} \left( E_{GaAs} - E_{Ga} - E_{As} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( E_{GaAs} - E_{Ga} - E_{As} \right) $$

**Finding the Formation Energy:**

The formation energy of GaAs is a well-established thermodynamic property. It can be found in various thermodynamic databases and literature.

According to standard thermodynamic data (e.g., from NIST, JANAF tables, or computational materials databases), the standard enthalpy of formation ($\Delta H_f^\circ$) for GaAs at 298.15 K is approximately:

$$ \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{GaAs}) \approx -72.8 \text{ kJ/mol} $$

To convert this to eV/atom, we need to perform the following conversions:

1.  **Convert kJ/mol to J/mol:**
    $-72.8 \text{ kJ/mol} \times 1000 \text{ J/kJ} = -72800 \text{ J/mol}$

2.  **Convert J/mol to J/atom:**
    We need to consider the number of atoms in one mole of GaAs. One mole of GaAs contains one mole of Ga atoms and one mole of As atoms, totaling two moles of atoms.
    Number of atoms per mole of GaAs = 2 moles of atoms/mol of GaAs
    Avogadro's number ($N_A$) = $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms/mol
    Number of atoms in one mole of GaAs = $2 \times N_A$ atoms

    Energy per atom = $\frac{-72800 \text{ J/mol}}{2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ atoms/mol}}$

3.  **Convert J to eV:**
    1 eV = $1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ J
    Energy per atom (in eV) = $\frac{\text{Energy per atom (in J)}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}}$

Let's calculate:

Energy per atom (in J) = $\frac{-72800}{2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx -6.056 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J/atom}$

Formation energy per atom (in eV) = $\frac{-6.056 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J/atom}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}} \approx -0.378 \text{ eV/atom}$

**Important Note on Formation Energy:**

The formation energy is often reported as a negative value, indicating that the formation of the compound from its elements is exothermic (energy is released). This signifies stability. However, when discussing ""formation energy per atom"" in the context of material stability, it's often the magnitude of this energy that is considered, or it's understood that a negative value implies stability.

In some contexts, especially in computational materials science, ""formation energy"" might refer to the energy difference calculated from first-principles calculations, which can be positive or negative depending on the reference states and computational methods. However, for established thermodynamic properties, the standard enthalpy of formation is the most reliable measure.

The formation energy is often reported as a negative value, indicating that the formation of the compound from its elements is exothermic (energy is released). This signifies stability. However, when discussing ""formation energy per atom"" in the context of material stability, it's often the magnitude of this energy that is considered, or it's understood that a negative value implies stability.

In some contexts, especially in computational materials science, ""formation energy"" might refer to the energy difference calculated from first-principles calculations, which can be positive or negative depending on the reference states and computational methods. However, for established thermodynamic properties, the standard enthalpy of formation is the most reliable measure.

**Formation Energy per Atom:**

The formation energy of a compound is the energy released or absorbed when it is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. For a compound with the chemical formula $A_x B_y$, the formation energy per atom is typically calculated as:

$$ \Delta H_f = \frac{1}{x+y} \left( E_{compound} - x E_{element A} - y E_{element B} \right) $$

Where:
*   $E_{compound}$ is the total energy of the compound.
*   $E_{element A}$ is the energy of element A in its standard state.
*   $E_{element B}$ is the energy of element B in its standard state.

For Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), the formula is $Ga_1 As_1$. So, $x=1$ and $y=1$. The formation energy per atom is:

$$ \Delta H_f (\text{GaAs}) = \frac{1}{1+1} \left( E_{GaAs} - E_{Ga} - E_{As} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( E_{GaAs} - E_{Ga} - E_{As} \right) $$

**Finding the Formation Energy:**

The formation energy of GaAs is a well-established thermodynamic property. It can be found in various thermodynamic databases and literature.

According to standard thermodynamic data (e.g., from NIST, JANAF tables, or computational materials databases), the standard enthalpy of formation ($\Delta H_f^\circ$) for GaAs at 298.15 K is approximately:

$$ \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{GaAs}) \approx -72.8 \text{ kJ/mol} $$

To convert this to eV/atom, we need to perform the following conversions:

1.  **Convert kJ/mol to J/mol:**
    $-72.8 \text{ kJ/mol} \times 1000 \text{ J/kJ} = -72800 \text{ J/mol}$

2.  **Convert J/mol to J/atom:**

    Number of atoms per mole of GaAs = 2 moles of atoms/mol of GaAs
    Avogadro's number ($N_A$) = $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms/mol
    Number of atoms in one mole of GaAs = $2 \times N_A$ atoms

    Energy per atom = $\frac{-72800 \text{ J/mol}}{2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ atoms/mol}}$

**Important Note on Formation Energy:**

The formation energy is often reported as a negative value, indicating that the formation of the compound from its elements is exothermic (energy is released). This signifies stability. However, when discussing ""formation energy per atom"" in the context of material stability, it's often the magnitude of this energy that is considered, or it's understood that a negative value implies stability.

In some contexts, especially in computational materials science, ""formation energy"" might refer to the energy difference calculated from first-principles calculations, which can be positive or negative depending on the reference states and computational methods. However, for established thermodynamic properties, the standard enthalpy of formation is the most reliable measure.

**Formation Energy per Atom:**

The formation energy of a compound is the energy released or absorbed when it is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. For a compound with the chemical formula $A_x B_y$, the formation energy per atom is typically calculated as:

$$ \Delta H_f = \frac{1}{x+y} \left( E_{compound} - x E_{element A} - y E_{element B} \right) $$

Where:
*   $E_{compound}$ is the total energy of the compound.
*   $E_{element A}$ is the energy of element A in its standard state.
*   $E_{element B}$ is the energy of element B in its standard state.

For Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), the formula is $Ga_1 As_1$. So, $x=1$ and $y=1$. The formation energy per atom is:

$$ \Delta H_f (\text{GaAs}) = \frac{1}{1+1} \left( E_{GaAs} - E_{Ga} - E_{As} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( E_{GaAs} - E_{Ga} - E_{As} \right) $$

**Finding the Formation Energy:**

The formation energy of GaAs is a well-established thermodynamic property. It can be found in various thermodynamic databases and literature.

**Important Note on Formation Energy:**

The formation energy is often reported as a negative value, indicating that the formation of the compound from its elements is exothermic (energy is released). This signifies stability. However, when discussing ""formation energy per atom"" in the context of material stability, it's often the magnitude of this energy that is considered, or it's understood that a negative value implies stability.

In some contexts, especially in computational materials science, ""formation energy"" might refer to the energy difference calculated from first-principles calculations, which can be positive or negative depending on the reference states and computational methods. However, for established thermodynamic properties, the standard enthalpy of formation is the most reliable measure.

**Finding the Formation Energy:**

The formation energy of GaAs is a well-established thermodynamic property. It can be found in various thermodynamic databases and literature.

According to standard thermodynamic data (e.g., from NIST, JANAF tables, or computational materials databases), the standard enthalpy of formation ($\Delta H_f^\circ$) for GaAs at 298.15 K is approximately:

$$ \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{GaAs}) \approx -72.8 \text{ kJ/mol} $$

To convert this to eV/atom, we need to perform the following conversions:

1.  **Convert kJ/mol to J/mol:**
    $-72.8 \text{ kJ/mol} \times 1000 \text{ J/kJ} = -72800 \text{ J/mol}$

2.  **Convert J/mol to J/atom:**
    We need to consider the number of atoms in one mole of GaAs. One mole of GaAs contains one mole of Ga atoms and one mole of As atoms, totaling two moles of atoms.
    Number of atoms per mole of GaAs = 2 moles of atoms/mol of GaAs
    Avogadro's number ($N_A$) = $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms/mol
    Number of atoms in one mole of GaAs = $2 \times N_A$ atoms

    Energy per atom = $\frac{-72800 \text{ J/mol}}{2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ atoms/mol}}$

3.  **Convert J to eV:**
    1 eV = $1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ J
    Energy per atom (in eV) = $\frac{\text{Energy per atom (in J)}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}}$

Let's calculate:

Energy per atom (in J) = $\frac{-72800}{2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx -6.056 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J/atom}$

Formation energy per atom (in eV) = $\frac{-6.056 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J/atom}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}} \approx -0.378 \text{ eV/atom}$

**Important Note on Formation Energy:**

The formation energy is often reported as a negative value, indicating that the formation of the compound from its elements is exothermic (energy is released). This signifies stability. However, when discussing ""formation energy per atom"" in the context of material stability, it's often the magnitude of this energy that is considered, or it's understood that a negative value implies stability.

In some contexts, especially in computational materials science, ""formation energy"" might refer to the energy difference calculated from first-principles calculations, which can be positive or negative depending on the reference states and computational methods. However, for established thermodynamic properties, the standard enthalpy of formation is the most reliable measure.

**Conclusion:**

*   **Material:** Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)
*   **Band Gap:** Approximately 1.42 eV
*   **Formation Energy per Atom:** Approximately **-0.378 eV/atom** (This negative value indicates that GaAs is energetically favorable to form from its constituent elements, signifying its stability.)",,1.0,False,,False,4.250152826309204
