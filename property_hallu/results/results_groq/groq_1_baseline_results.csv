Without direct access to the Materials Project database or similar resources in this interaction, recalling specific material properties like the formation energy per atom of mp-2084 requires prior knowledge or a database query.

## 5: Known information about mp-2084
mp-2084 is known to be LiFePO4, a compound used in lithium-ion batteries. Its formation energy per atom can be calculated or looked up from thermodynamic data.

## 6: Formation energy of LiFePO4
The formation energy of LiFePO4 from its elements (Li, Fe, P, O) can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Li} + \text{Fe} + \text{P} + 4\text{O} \rightarrow \text{LiFePO}_4 \]
The standard formation enthalpy (\(\Delta H_f\)) of LiFePO4 is approximately -1167 kJ/mol (or -1.167 eV/atom * 6.022 * 10^23 atoms/mol, adjusting units).

## 7: Calculate formation energy per atom
Given that LiFePO4 has 7 atoms per formula unit, the formation energy per atom can be calculated if the total formation energy is known.

## 8: Known formation energy
The formation energy per formula unit of LiFePO4 is approximately -3.03 eV. With 7 atoms per formula unit, the formation energy per atom is \(-3.03 / 7 \approx -0.433\) eV/atom.
